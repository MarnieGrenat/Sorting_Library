Java Library for sorting data. This is a **work in progress**. This project will contain:
Sorting Algorithm | 
----------------|
- [x] Insertion Sort 
- [x] Selection Sort 
- [x] Bubble Sort 
- [x] Shell Sort 
- [x] Merge Sort 
- [ ] Heap Sort 
- [ ] Quick Sort 
- [ ] Quick3 Sort 

If you fell tempted to use this library, fell free to do so. Everything here is not Marnie's intelectual property, I just wanted to concatenate every sorting algorithm I know in one document. If you're a student, I suggest you to do the same, since it will improve your **ability of analyzing algorithms**. If you think that there's a better way of coding something or that there's algorithms missing, fell free to contact me: here's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarnieGrenat) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriela-dellamora/)!
Here, I'm going to document from time to time every information needed to use this library. Not just it, but extra info about the creators of the algorithms here presented or about the algorithm itself will be added.

All the algorithms will have 3 divisions: one method for integer values, one for double values and one for STRING. **in this version, I only added methods for integer values**, since it's a little project in progress.
